# TODOs:

 -  Make Exercises for dplyr/data.table
 -  Make Exercises for automatic reporting
 -  Add Quarto to automatic reporting as a hint.

 - (Add bonus material as an additional category at the top)

# Repo to update the materials for the R course

Idea is, to recycle parts from the courses before.

Decided on Quarto. Don't know whether this was a good idea...

Currently, it is rendered and published as full webpage at [https://raphaelre.quarto.pub/r-course/](https://raphaelre.quarto.pub/r-course/)
