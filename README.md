# Repo to update the materials for the R course

Idea is, to recycle parts from the courses before.

Decided on Quarto. Don't know whether this was a good idea...

The repo should have 3 parts:
- Slides (or switch back to script?)
- Exercises + Solutions
- Data Project (t.b.d. if we want to update it)
